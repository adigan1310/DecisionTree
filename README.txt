1) Open command prompt and open the directory that contains the ID3.py file or open any Python IDE and run the file.
2) Enter the commmand "python <filename>.py <path of training data setfile> <path of test data set file> <path of validation data set file>
Example is as follows:
	"python ID3.py F:/Data_set1/training_Set.csv F:/Data_set1/test_Set.csv F:/Data_set1/validation_set.csv"
